The `if` statement inside the `__call__` method is designed to handle the
decorator logic by distinguishing between two phases. When the decorator is
first applied, it translates the call into something like
`HTMLTag("b")(say_hello)`. This triggers the `if` block because the function
is passed as an argument, allowing the class to save the function and return
the instance. Later, when the decorated function is executed, `__call__` is
invoked again but without arguments. This triggers the `else` block, where
the stored function is executed and its result is wrapped in the desired
HTML tags.
